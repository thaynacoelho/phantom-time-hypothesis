# Phantom time hypothesis
This repository was created as an assignment for the Modern Web Design course at [The Gymnasium](http://www.thegymnasium.com).

My final goal for this course is to create a simple, multi-page website using content from a Wikipedia article (of
your choosing) as the source.

Instructions from Lesson 1:
- [x] You will need a way to host your HTML, CSS, and JavaScript code online. We recommend using GitHub
and specifically GitHub Pages to do this. First, sign up for an account at GitHub.com if you don’t have one
already. Then go to pages.github.com, and follow the tutorial on how to use GitHub Pages for hosting (you
will want to follow the instructions for a Project Site.)
- [x] The next assignment is to decide what subject you want to use for your website. In order to do this, go to
Wikipedia and find an article with enough content to fill at least five pages and have a handful of images.
Feel free to use the instructor’s Wikipedia article on cuttlefish as a reference, but we highly encourage you
to take the time and choose a subject of your liking, you will be working with the material for 6 lessons, so it
should be material you are interested in!

Instructions from Lesson 2:
- [x] Quiz.
- [x] Begin marking up the content from the article you chose on Wikipedia in Lesson 1. The goal is to create a
bare bones HTML document that will become the foundation of your website. 
- [x] Create a blank text document with an HTML extension, paste the text from the Wikipedia article you
chose into that document, and open it in a browser, and see how it looks.
- [x] Return to the document and begin adding different elements like <code>html</code>, <code>head</code>, <code>body</code>, and <code>title</code>. Save it, view that page in the browser and see how it’s changed.
- [x] Go back and add some text-level semantics—for example <code>emphasis</code> or <code>i</code> or <code>b</code> or some links.
Continue refining the document and keep looking at the browser and see how it’s changed.
- [x] When you’re happy with your file, go ahead and push that up to Github and post a link in the forum.
Your Github repository should look a little bit something like this: [I Heart Cuttlefish](http://aarongustafson.github.io/i-heart-cuttlefish/)

Instructions from Lesson 3:
- [x] Quiz.
- [x] Return to your HTML page that you created at the end of Lesson 2, and begin to organize your
content using the knowledge gained in this lesson. For example, return to your main document and
think about how you could break it up into multiple pages.
- [x] Add some navigation so that you can move between the different documents. 
- [x] Finally, go through all of your documents and add the logical flow and structural elements that
were discussed in this lesson, such as <code>main</code> and <code>section</code> elements.
- [x] When complete, publish your work up to GitHub and post a link in the forum.

Instructions from Lesson 4:
- [x] Quiz.
- [ ] Think about the way the browsers styles the text content of your documents.
- [ ] Are your pages easy to scan and comfortable to read?
- [ ] How could you use typography to improve readability and enforce content hierarchy and importance?
- [ ] How do different font families look when paired with each other?
- [ ] Test out some different font stacks and note how fallbacks differ.
- [ ] Return your site and think about how color could improve the readability and usability of your pages.
- [ ] Try out a few different color forms (hex, RGB, HSL). Which feels more natural? Are there pros and cons to working in each?
- [ ] Does your design have enough contrast? Check it using the Greyscale plug-in for Chrome.
- [ ] Add borders and padding to elements on your pages.
- [ ] Play with different display models (especially inline and inline-block) and see how they affect the way elements lay out with respect to one another.
- [ ] How does adjusting an element's size help add weight to it or diminish its visibility as compared to other elements?
- [ ] Explore the box model and the different display modes covered in this lesson.
- [ ] Publish your work to Github and post a link in the forum along with your observations.
