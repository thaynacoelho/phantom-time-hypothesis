# Phantom time hypothesis
This repository was created as an assignment for the Modern Web Design course at [The Gymnasium](http://www.thegymnasium.com).

Instructions from Lesson 2:
- [x] Begin marking up the content from the article you chose on Wikipedia in Lesson 1. The goal is to create a
bare bones HTML document that will become the foundation of your website. 
- [x] Create a blank text document with an HTML extension, paste the text from the Wikipedia article you
chose into that document, and open it in a browser, and see how it looks.
- [x] Return to the document and begin adding different elements like <code>html</code>, <code>head</code>, <code>body</code>, and
<code>title</code>. Save it, view that page in the browser and see how it’s changed.
- [ ] Go back and add some text-level semantics—for example <code>emphasis</code> or <code>i</code> or <code>b</code> or some links.
Continue refining the document and keep looking at the browser and see how it’s changed.
- [ ] When you’re happy with your file, go ahead and push that up to Github and post a link in the forum.
Your Github repository should look a little bit something like this: [I Heart Cuttlefish](http://aarongustafson.github.io/i-heart-cuttlefish/)
