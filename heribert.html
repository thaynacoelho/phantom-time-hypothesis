From 1989 to 1994 he acted as editor of the journal Vorzeit-Frühzeit-Gegenwart.

Before focusing on the early medieval period, Illig published various proposals for revised chronologies 
of prehistory and of Ancient Egypt. His proposals received prominent coverage in German popular media in the 1990s. 
His 1996 Das erfundene Mittelalter also received scholarly recensions, but was universally rejected as fundamentally 
flawed by historians.<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phantom_time_hypothesis#cite_note-3">[3]</a> 
In 1997, the journal Ethik und Sozialwissenschaften offered a platform for critical discussion to Illig's proposal, 
with a number of historians commenting on its various aspects.
